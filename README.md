# Ensemble Learning for Student Exam Score Prediction

This project uses **ensemble machine learning** techniques in Google Colab to predict student exam scores based on a rich set of academic, behavioral, and socio-economic features. The notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a Voting Regressor that combines several popular regression models.

## Project Overview

This notebook applies an ensemble of regression models to predict students' exam scores using a dataset with features such as study habits, social media usage, sleep, parental education, and more. The ensemble approach leverages the strengths of multiple regressors, resulting in more robust and accurate predictions.

---

## Features

- **Rich Feature Set:** Includes academic, lifestyle, and background features.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combines Linear Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and XGBoost regressors using a VotingRegressor.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles encoding, missing values, and scaling.
- **Model Evaluation:** Compares individual models and the ensemble using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R².
- **Google Colab Ready:** No local setup required-run everything in the cloud.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore feature importance and performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Google Colab**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models and preprocessing
- **XGBoost** – Advanced gradient boosting
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – Data visualization

## Setup Instructions (Google Colab)

1. **Open the Notebook:**
   - Upload or open `Ensemble_learning.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   - The notebook includes code to install any missing packages (such as `xgboost`).  
     If not, run:
     ```
     !pip install xgboost
     ```

3. **Upload the Dataset:**
   - Use the Colab file upload widget if prompted, or ensure the dataset is loaded in the notebook.

4. **Run All Cells:**
   - Click `Runtime > Run all` to execute the notebook from start to finish.

---

## Usage

- **Step 1:** Open `Ensemble_learning.ipynb` in Google Colab.
- **Step 2:** Run all cells to perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Step 3:** Review the output cells for model performance metrics and visualizations.
- **Step 4:** Modify or extend the notebook to experiment with features, models, or hyperparameters.

---

## Model Architecture

The ensemble uses a **VotingRegressor** to combine predictions from:

- `LinearRegression()`
- `RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)`
- `KNeighborsRegressor()`
- `XGBRegressor(random_state=42)`

**Example:**
from sklearn.ensemble import VotingRegressor
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor
from xgboost import XGBRegressor

ensemble = VotingRegressor([
('lr', LinearRegression()),
('rf', RandomForestRegressor(random_state=42)),
('knn', KNeighborsRegressor()),
('xgb', XGBRegressor(random_state=42))
])


---

## Troubleshooting

- **ModuleNotFoundError:**  
  Run `!pip install xgboost` or any other missing package in a Colab cell.
- **Data Not Found:**  
  Make sure you upload the dataset as instructed in the notebook.
- **Colab Runtime Disconnects:**  
  Save your work frequently and consider breaking long-running cells into smaller steps.
- **Model Not Training:**  
  Check for data preprocessing issues or missing values.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV).
- Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
- Integrate more advanced ensemble methods (e.g., stacking).
- Deploy as a web app for real-time predictions.
- Add explainability (e.g., SHAP, LIME).
- Support for classification tasks (e.g., pass/fail prediction).
